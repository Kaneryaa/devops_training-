1. pods that run a single container 
   -> the one-container per pod model is the most common kubernetes use case
   -> pod as a wrapper around a single container
   -> kubernetes manages the pods rather than the container directly
2. multi container pod
   ->tightly coupled and need to share resources 
   ->one main container and other as sidecar or init container 
   -> each pod is meant to run a single instance of a given application 
   -> should use multlple pods to scale horizantally
